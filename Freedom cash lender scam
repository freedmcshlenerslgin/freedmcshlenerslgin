Freedom cash lender scam

However, if you take a short-term cash advance, the high interest rate applies for only a week or two. In many cases, this can keep the loan affordable.

Installment loans have higher total costs since a relatively high APR applies to periods of up to 72 months. You may end up paying a lot of interest, but it will be stretched out over many months or years.

While frivolous borrowing is usually not a good idea, a long-term installment loan may be worth the cost if you really need the loan. A “good” cash advance is an affordable one with a reasonable APR and used for a necessary reason.

For example, if you need medical care or have some other important necessity, a cash advance could make a lot of sense. Conversely, using a cash advance, or any loan, to support a gambling habit or some other negative behavior is definitely a bad idea.
